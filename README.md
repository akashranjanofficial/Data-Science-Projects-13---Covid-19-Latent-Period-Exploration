# Data-Science-Projects-13---Covid-19-Latent-Period-Exploration
The incubation period for the COVID-19 is reported. We can't say the same for the latent period (the period since the person is infected but does not spread the infection yet), which is vital characteristic of every infectious disease. Knowing the latent period gives an ability to run simulations which are far more accurate. In this study I try to estimate the latent period for COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus via computational simulations using SEIR model with different values controlling the latent period length (e.g. latent period parameter sweep). I try to fit all other parameters to match the observed statistics the best. I do such modelling for 5 different locations worldwide which are currently experiencing different stages of the epidemic.  As a result, Europe locations suggest that latent period is between 2 and 4 days: Austria case suggests the value of 48-96 hours, Italy case suggests the value greater than 48 hours. While China cases suggest shorter latent period.
